# NGINX Ops project

* A production ready Nginx configuration that uses modular architecture (rather than traditional one), and is container based. It can turn any infrastructure into a **secure reverse-proxy and load-balancer**.
* It has support for traffic splitting (canary deployment) to servers, letting you route only a chosen percentage of your platformâ€™s traffic to a new feature.

---

## What it does

* Load balances / splits traffic across any number of back-end services (`round robin algorithm`). Traffic splitting is possible via upstream weighting.
* Provides reverse proxy capabilities
* Adds modern security headers & sane DoS protections
* Terminates TLS 1.2/1.3, and forces HTTPS
* Supports web socket communication via protocol upgrade
* JSON access logs ready for ELK / Loki

---



## How it works

* `docker-entrypoint.sh` renders that one `*.template` with `envsubst`, so you inject `SITE_FQDN`, `SITE_CERT`, `SITE_KEY` at run-time.  
* All other files are copied and parsed automatically by NGINX.

---



## Prerequisites

* **Docker** 20.10+  
* **docker-compose** v2  
* PEM-encoded certificate and key inside `certs/` & `keys/`. You can use openssl tool to generate the certificate.
* Replace server URLs in upstream.conf with your desired hosts. You can use "**python3 -m http.server <port>**" to start base servers.
